Admin
~~~~~

The Admin section allows you to create administrators who have access the admin screens. Levels of 
access can be set. If the administrator is to be allowed to make calls, then a gateway and dialer-
settings must be set for that administrator.


Customers
~~~~~~~~~

Customers only have access to the customer panel. Before a customer can make calls, they must have
both dialer-settings and a gateway attached to their account.



Sites
~~~~~

Some of the features of Newfies-Dialer are dependent on the hostname or IP address, so this has to 
be set correctly in site address.
 
In the Admin dashboard, locate the “Sites” link and click change. By default, there will be an entry
of “example.com”. Edit this setting to reflect the hostname of the server, or if you do not have 
this set up, the IP address. e.g.  http://www.domain.tld:8008 or in the case of an IP address, 
http://192.168.1.200:8008

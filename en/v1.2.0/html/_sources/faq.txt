What's the history behind Newfies-Dialer?
-----------------------------------------

**Answer:** .

Newfies-Dialer is a bulk dialer application which was commissioned by a charity named Kubatana (http://www.kubatana.net) based in Zimbabwe, which sponsors the Freedomfone project (http://www.freedomfone.org/) dedicated to providing information via phone technology.

In less economically developed countries, Internet is often limited, but there is usually comprehensive mobile phone coverage. Freedomfone uses Newfies-Dialer to dial up peopleâ€™s phones and offer health information on Cholera, Malaria and so many other avoidable health issues in the third world, which may be alleviated by education. Newfies-Dialer was so named after the Newfoundland Dog nicknamed Newfies and used by sea rescue services around the world.
